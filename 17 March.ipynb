    "Q1.Missing values refer to the absence of a particular data point in a dataset. This can happen due to various reasons such as data collection errors, data corruption, or incomplete data entries. Handling missing values is crucial because it can lead to biased or inaccurate results in statistical analyses and machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to handle missing values in a dataset. One common approach is to impute the missing values by estimating or filling in a value based on the available data. Another approach is to remove the missing values altogether, but this can result in a reduction of the dataset's size and possibly a loss of information.\n",

    "Some algorithms that are not affected by missing values include decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines (SVMs). These algorithms can handle missing values by ignoring the affected feature during the split or classification process, without needing any imputation or removal of the missing values. Other algorithms such as linear regression and k-nearest neighbors (KNN) are sensitive to missing values and require some form of imputation or removal."

    "If imbalanced data is not handled, it can lead to biased or inaccurate results in machine learning models, especially for the minority class. For example, a model trained on imbalanced data may have a high accuracy but low recall for the minority class, which means it may fail to identify instances of the minority class correctly. This is because the model tends to favor the majority class, which can be due to the nature of the algorithms used in the training process.\n",

This technique is often used when the number of instances in the minority class is small compared to the majority class. For example, in a fraud detection dataset where only a small percentage of transactions are fraudulent, upsampling can be used to increase the number of fraudulent transactions to make the dataset more balanced. One commonly used upsampling technique is the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE), which generates new synthetic instances of the minority class by interpolating between existing instances.\n",

This is an imbalanced dataset as the positive class is significantly smaller than the negative class.\n",

This will increase the number of positive instances in the dataset and make the class distribution more balanced. You can then use this up-sampled dataset to train your machine learning model.\n",
